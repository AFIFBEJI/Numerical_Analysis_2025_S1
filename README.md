## Project Goals

This project is aimed at achieving the following objectives:

- **Enhance Pedagogical Support:**  
  Provide instructors with robust didactical resources, such as code examples, animations, and teaching aids, to better explain Numerical Analysis concepts in a classroom setting.

- **Support Student Learning:**  
  Facilitate students’ understanding of **core Numerical Analysis methods** through interactive and visual learning experiences. Students will be able to explore key concepts such as **numerical methods for solving equations, interpolation, numerical integration, and optimization** with hands-on examples.

- **Leverage Manim for Mathematical Visualizations:**  
  Create clear and engaging visualizations using **Manim**, an animation library, to demonstrate the inner workings of common Numerical Analysis algorithms. These animations will serve as a visual aid for both students and instructors.

- **Develop Beginner-Friendly Educational Videos:**  
  Produce a series of **explainable educational videos** that break down complex Numerical Analysis concepts into easy-to-understand, step-by-step guides. These videos will feature real-world applications to make the concepts more relatable to students with no prior advanced knowledge.

- **Build an Interactive Web Application:**  
  Develop an **interactive, web-based application** that allows students and users to experiment with Numerical Analysis methods. This application will provide users with the ability to manipulate algorithms, visualize results, and gain practical experience.
